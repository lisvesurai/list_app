This project is built with Angular. It’s a code challenge I’ve worked on for one of the companies I’ve had an interview with.

This project is a simple list app that allows users to create multiple lists, and add items to their lists. List names and list items are editable. It also allows users to assign a color to each list.

Icons used in this project comes from fontello.com. This helps keep the file size smaller since I can pick the only icons I'm using.
