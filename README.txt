This project is built with Angular. It’s a code challenge I’ve worked on for one of the companies I’ve had an interview with.

The question for the challenge was: Create a mobile web app that allows you to create, edit, and view short notes. Notes are just small textual items, like to-do lists.
- Notes should be stored using browser local storage
- The app should be usable on a standard mobile browser

This app is a simple list app that allows users to create multiple lists, and add items to their lists. List names and list items are editable. It also allows users to assign a color to each list.

Icons used in this project comes from fontello.com. This helps keep the file size smaller since I can pick the only icons I'm using.
